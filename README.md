# Movie-Revenue-Prediction-Model
This linear regression model predicts the worldwide gross revenue of a film based on its production budget. In other words, it establishes a relationship between the amount of money spent on producing a film and the amount of money it earns at the box office.

Here's what the model does:

1. Takes in the production budget: The model accepts a production budget as input, which is the 
   amount of money spent on producing a film.
2. Predicts the worldwide gross revenue: Based on the production budget, the model predicts the 
   worldwide gross revenue of the film, which is the total amount of money earned by the film at 
   the box office.
   
The model uses a simple linear equation to make this prediction.
